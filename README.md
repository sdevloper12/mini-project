# mini-project
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player competes against the computer by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The computer generates a random choice, and the winner is decided instantly using game logic. This project demonstrates JavaScript basics, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
